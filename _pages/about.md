This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.
