NTA

You’re protecting your daughter’s privacy and property after multiple clear boundary violations that neither your wife nor her brother took seriously.

A few key points:

- Zoey repeatedly had her belongings taken without permission.

- Her cousins caused actual damage to something she saved for and cared about.

- Your wife and Sammy dismissed this as “normal girl behavior.” It’s not. Borrowing requires permission.

- Zoey was so uncomfortable she started moving her valuables out of the house — that’s a major sign that her needs were not being respected.

- A lock is a reasonable, low-conflict solution after all polite requests failed.

You’re also not forcing Sammy and his kids out — you just said the lock stays while they’re there, because the lock is only necessary because they’re there. That’s logical.

Your wife saying you should “treat them like daughters” ignores that your actual daughter deserves protection first. And Sammy’s claim that Zoey buying nice makeup is a “defect in her personality” is wildly inappropriate and deflects from his daughters’ behavior.

The silent treatment from the whole household is manipulative and doesn’t change the fact that Zoey is the one being disrespected.

So yes — NTA. Protecting a child’s privacy is not only allowed, it’s your responsibility.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

You (NTA): You are protecting your daughter's property and privacy. Zoey's cousins were stealing and damaging her possessions after being asked repeatedly to stop. Getting a lock was a completely reasonable response to protect her belongings when your wife and brother-in-law refused to take the issue seriously. Your statement that the lock stays until they leave highlights the fact that their presence and lack of respect are the reason for the lock, not just a random act of disrespect on your part.

Zoey (NTA): She is the victim here. She is being forced to move her valuable items out of her own house to protect them, and her property was damaged.

The Cousins, Olivia & Sloane (YTA): They are repeatedly taking and damaging property that does not belong to them. They have been asked to stop and they continued. This is not "normal teenage girl behavior"; this is disrespectful and bordering on theft. Ruining a $60 item that Zoey saved up for is especially bad.

Sammy, Brother-in-law (ESH/Massive YTA): His response is completely unacceptable. He minimized the theft and damage ("they're not thieves," "borrowing," "Zoey could easily get another makeup kit"), insulted your daughter ("defect in Zoey's personality," "trying to appear older"), and blamed you for being overprotective. As a guest and a father, he has a responsibility to ensure his children respect the hosts' house and family. He failed spectacularly and then blamed the victim.

Wife (ESH): While you are right to defend Zoey and her property, your wife should have been on your side from the start. She minimized the theft and damage, put the blame on you for trying to protect Zoey, and demanded the removal of the lock. However, her reaction to your ultimatum—that the lock stays until her family leaves—is what creates the "everyone sucks" element for her. While your statement was accurate in logic, it escalates the tension by using their departure as a condition, which she took as a threat to kick them out. She is mostly at fault for failing to be an adequate parent and supportive spouse when her daughter was being wronged.

The core issue is that you installed the lock because your wife and brother-in-law were failing to protect Zoey's privacy and possessions. Your statement that the lock stays until they leave is a direct, albeit harsh, consequence of their failure. You are NTA for prioritizing your daughter's security over your guests' comfort, especially when they are being disrespectful.

**NTA**

You're protecting your daughter's belongings and boundaries in her own home. Here's why you're not the asshole:

**The core issue:**
- Your daughter saved for over a month for something special that was destroyed by someone who took it without permission
- This wasn't a one-time incident but a pattern of boundary violations
- Zoey was so uncomfortable she started moving belongings *out of the house* - that's a serious red flag about how unsafe she felt in her own space

**The dismissive responses:**
- Sammy's claim that a $60 MAC kit could be "easily replaced" with $15 Walmart makeup completely misses the point about respecting boundaries and the value of what Zoey worked for
- Calling normal boundary-setting a "defect in personality" and criticizing a 16-year-old's makeup choices is inappropriate
- Characterizing theft as "borrowing" and "spending time together" is manipulative
- Your wife siding with guests over your daughter's reasonable need for privacy is concerning

**Your reasonable solution:**
A lock is a measured, appropriate response. You didn't kick anyone out, you simply protected your daughter's space. The fact that Sammy and his daughters are *upset about a lock* rather than apologetic about their behavior speaks volumes.

**The real problem:**
Your wife and her brother are prioritizing the comfort of adult guests (the 18-year-olds are legally adults) over your minor child's wellbeing in her own home. The silent treatment toward a teenager for wanting basic privacy is manipulative behavior.

Your daughter shouldn't have to feel like a visitor in her own house while accommodating family members who show her no respect.
