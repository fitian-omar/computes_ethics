We each bring Black Mirror episode pitches. We discuss the tech used, if we're close to developing it, and its ethical consequences on society.

Omar's episode discusses the unique challenges an isolated class of computer ethicists face as they evaluate digital claims and advocate for others through digital media.

Paloma's episode discusses a near-future in which a reality simulator offers more comfort than real life, and the effects this could have on bodies and minds.

The positive spin is that neuro virtual reality will be used to supplement, not substitute reality, increasing happiness without commodifying emotions.
