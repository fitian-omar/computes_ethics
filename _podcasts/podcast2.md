The podcast discusses the use of popular LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT in searching for scientific literature, specifically asking for statistics on the gig economy. We discuss the accuracy of information, hallucinations, and ethical implications of this use.

Our prompt:
Find five statistics about the gig economy and its impact on workers’ rights using only trustworthy, peer-reviewed scholarly sources such as journals indexed in PubMed, Elsevier, Springer, or Nature. Include the exact quoted sentence or table excerpt where each statistic appears, the full citation with a DOI or direct link, the year of publication and when the data were collected if mentioned, and clearly state where in the source the quote is located, such as the page, table, or figure. Explain why each quote matters in the context of understanding the gig economy and workers’ rights, and do not include or assume any information that is not explicitly supported by the original source.
