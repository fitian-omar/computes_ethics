Now is the time to reflect on my work this past semester. It was not easy to get used to the blog format and it was challenging to understand how to tailor my language for a diverse audience. It is difficult to guess what you know that others may not.

My most challenging blog was [Blog 7: Right to Fair Representation](https://fitian-omar.github.io/computes_ethics/posts/2025/09/blog-post-7/)

I chose it because that post required bridging my background in social theory with a deeply technical case study on AI models. The difficulty came from explaining complex concepts like specificity, Orientalism, and strategic essentialism in a way that a general audience could understand without diluting their meaning. What earned it this title was the intellectual tension of holding together computation, social theory, and cultural criticism in a single piece. It pushed me to reorganise dense arguments into clearer, more intentional writing.

It was also my most personal blog because I  struggle with the tension of avoiding being a native informant and striving towards being an organic intellectual. This is important to me because I feel a sense of duty towards my community but also recognise the need to protect my interests.

My most edited blog was [Blog 2: Crafting Arguments](https://fitian-omar.github.io/computes_ethics/posts/2025/09/blog-post-2/)

This was a challenging post because the horrors of automated killing and an industry innovating ways to kill humans should sound dystopian to anyone. It was difficult to write my thoughts in a way that made it clear why this phenomenon happens. Understanding how human-created systems eventually dominate humans to perpetuate themselves is important in navigating the modern world and it was important to learn how to deliver this information, although initially I did not know what aspects were inaccessible.

Across the semester my writing became clearer, more structured, and more mindful of audience. I would like to think that I am capable of clearly explaining computational and social technical concepts to laymen. The revision process was helpful but at times I felt demotivated to rewrite my posts.

I prefer traditional essays. Writing essays allow me to be more precise with my language while I advance my argument. Fleshing out definitions in blog posts is added work that is also difficult to see because I felt I could not reliably estimate what my hyopthetical audience knows or doesn't know. However, I understand the importance of accessibility and I feel more confident in explaining things in simpler terms.

Across my blogs, I noticed that I gravitate towards social, political, and philosophical analyis. This is due to my liberal arts training, where I've learned to synthesise knowledge across disciplines in the pursuit of knowledge. This is also due to my understanding of ethics as contingent on power and history. Germans and White US Americans believed they were ethical, yet the Holocaust and slavery were their doing. This should tell us that ethics cannot be treated in a vacuum from the social and material context of the world. We need to pay attention to how power first and foremost determines what counts as ethical or not, and how it will always rationalise a moral state of exception to fulfill its work. While asking how one can live ethically and design ethical systems is important, I believe that the world is immoral, preferring to answer the question: how does power determine ethics and how do we document and subvert it? It is one thing to ponder how to create ethical exceptions for data-driven rule and another to question why the credit score system exists, why bureaucracy replaces organic forms of governance, and why states feel compelled to police at all. In this sense, I wanted my approach to be radical, meaning going to the heart of the issue rather than treating symptoms.

My favorite posts were the ones involving cultural representation, as I enjoy thinking about the boundaries of what counts as idiosynratic vs. cultural. I also enjoyed thinking about how LLMs can contain bias from their training data, as this is a bias real people can have as well. For example, people only reading a religious text will exclusively demonstrate and advocate its own set of values and epistemologies.

Blog writing did help me deepen my understanding of ethical decisions in software design. It was especially valuable to think of my summer internship within this conext.

I will probably add the blog posts here to my professional portfolio. However, I will be sure to revise them to be more accessible. Thank you for taking the time to guide my thinking and writing.

In the future, it is hard to imagine myself changing my writing style, as I like to be reflective and critical. However, I hope to be clearer because I felt embarrassed when my thoughts were not communicated clearly. It felt like I was having constant linguistic failures which impacted my self-esteem as a secondary English speaker.

My writing goal for the future is to be in a place where I am understood without the need for multiple iterations. I will hope to do this by reviewing my writing to ensure that I do not make any implicit jumps in arguments or fail to idenify key concepts.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.
