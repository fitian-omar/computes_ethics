[Case study](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/artificial-why-copyright-is-not-the-right-policy-tool-to-deal-with-generative-ai)

The case study explores the philosophical, legal, and practical dimensions of copyright laws in the the use of creative materials for AI training. It argues that extending copyright laws to AI-generated content stifles innovation and fails to protect creators when it comes to issues of compensation, consent, and attribution.

First, Mantegna invites us to to question "philosophical rationales that justify the existence of intellectual property." While they elaborate on this discussion elsewhere, this is an important critical lens that probes the assumptions of the case study: why and should intellectual property exist? I believe that knowledge production has been largely impossible without stratification. Intellectuals require education, time, and resources (in our society all can be collapsed under "capital") to invent and create, which they are awarded based on their privilege in the socioeconomic structure. Therefore, their products should be appropriated for the benefit of all. I don't mean to imply that structurally disadvantaged people are incapable of innovation, but the desire to receive material or symbolic compensation for perceived merit is individualistic. The question of how to preserve the livelihood of inventors is invoked, but perhaps we should avoid this question and assert everyone's right to resources like universal income.

Speaking of the extent of human intervention required for work to be considered creative is an old debate on aesthetics. Another example, photography, comes to mind, which was derided for being mechanistic, easy to do, and infinitely replicable, devaluing the artwork. Proponents of photography maintain that there is much creative expression involved in the medium: the exposure triangle, the composition of the photo, the subject, etc. We can translate these arguments to the case of GAI. We can view the intentional inclusion of certain training data as a creative choice, as well as engineering prompts. These are the only arguments for considering GAI work creative that I can think of, and they are weak ones.Personally, I am offended that this is a point of conversation. In a world of unprecedented wealth disparity, it is obscene to debate the artistic merit of soulless machines while living, breathing people are starving and homeless, incapable of receiving artistic acknowledgement because of their precarity. I also think that it's unfortunate that machines produce art, a stubbornly human thing, while humans labor endlessly (and needlessly). Art is a sacred human exercise that aestheticises a purposeless world through unrestrained subjectivity; to turn it into a computational process is to beat its very purpose of restoring immediacy. This is why GAI art is not only unethical-because its very existence points to structural inequality-but pornographic.
